My interests mostly lie at the interface between ecology, animal behaviour, and the human dimensions of conservation. Specific topics of interest include the ecological consequences of behavioural changes induced by the presence of other species, such as invasive species or predators, the importance of individual behaviour for ecosystem-level patterns, causal inference in ecological modelling, and the processes by which conservation decisions are made.
