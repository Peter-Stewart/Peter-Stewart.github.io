    excerpt: 'I am an **ecologist and conservationist** interested in the interface between ecology, animal behaviour, and the human dimensions of conservation. 
    <br /><br />
    I am currently undertaking my PhD with the Conservation Ecology Group at Durham University, on the **impacts of invasive prickly pear cacti *(Opuntia sp.)* in Laikipia County, Kenya.** As part of this project I manage [Prickly Pear Project Kenya](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/peter-dot-stewart/prickly-pear-project-kenya) on Zooniverse.'
