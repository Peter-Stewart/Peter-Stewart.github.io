    excerpt: 'I am an **ecologist and conservationist** interested in the interface between ecology, animal behaviour, and the human dimensions of conservation. 
    <br /><br />
    I am currently a **postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Stirling**, working on modelling the distribution of invasive tree pests and diseases in the UK.
 <br /><br />
Previously, I undertook my PhD with the [Durham Invasion Science Lab](https://durhaminvasionscience.org/) and the [Conservation Ecology Group](http://www.conservationecology.org/) at Durham University, on the impacts of invasive prickly pear cacti *(Opuntia sp.)* in Laikipia County, Kenya. As part of this project I created and managed [Prickly Pear Project Kenya](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/peter-dot-stewart/prickly-pear-project-kenya) on Zooniverse.'
