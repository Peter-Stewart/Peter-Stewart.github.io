In this post, I cover how to fit two simple models of population growth using Stan: exponential growth, and logistic growth. I also cover how to use R to simulate data to fit these models to.

# Introduction, and an idea for a series

I recently decided that I'd like to learn more about Stan, and especially about how to fit different kinds of models - more than just the glm's which I've been learning about since undergrad. I also enjoy learning about theoretical ecology, and thought it would be cool to combine these two interests - and hopefully help some people along the way! As a result, I decided it would be cool to learn how to fit some classic ecological models using Stan, and to share my learning in these posts.

I was also inspired by a couple of examples of people doing this already - [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.9164) on fitting the SIR disease transmission model by LÃ©o Grinsztajn and colleagues made me realise just how versatile Stan could be, and was a major contributor towards me deciding to learn it. The second example is the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model as demonstrated by Richard McElreath [in Statistical Rethinking](https://youtu.be/Doaod09YitA?t=3344) - the impact of predators on prey populations is something I've been interested in for years (ever since an essay assignment I particularly enjoyed as an undergrad), so it was very exciting to learn that I could fit models like this in Stan.

I don't really have a definition for what constitutes a 'classic' model - I thought I'd just start off with some models I was taught about as an undergrad or have read about in books, and follow my interests from there. If there's a model that you'd like to see featured, then feel free to drop me a message - there's no guarantee that I'll cover it (not least because I may be unable to code it...), but I'll do my best!

# Acknowledgements and other resources

I learned a lot about modeling from the book [a biologist's guide to mathematical modeling in ecology and evolution](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691123448/a-biologists-guide-to-mathematical-modeling-in-ecology-and-evolution) by Sarah Otto and Troy Day, and it was one of the main resources I used when writing this post.

I also learned a great deal from the classic book [theoretical ecology: principles and applications (3rd ed.)](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199209989.001.0001/isbn-9780199209989), edited by Robert May and Angela McLean - the chapter on single-species dynamics by Tim Coulson and Charles Godfray is most relevant here, but the whole book is fantastic and well worth reading.

As for my knowledge about Stan, I mainly learned from the book and online course [Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022) by Richard McElreath, and also found Michael Betancourt's [introduction to Stan](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/stan_intro.html) to be very useful.

For more differential-equation-specific Stan knowledge, I mostly learned from the [Stan manual](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_29/stan-users-guide/ode-solver.html), supplemented by [this post](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/convert_odes.html) about (relatively) recent changes to the ODE interface and [this tutorial](https://mpopov.com/tutorials/ode-stan-r/) by Mikhail Popov.

# Exponential growth

## Introducing the model

Organisms are born, and then they die. From these two facts, we can build the most simple model of population growth:

$$
\frac{dn}{dt} = bn(t) - dn(t)
$$

where the population size is $n$, time is $t$, the birth rate is $b$, and the death rate is $d$. This model is an **ordinary differential equation (ODE)**, which describes how the derivative $(\frac{dn}{dt}$: the tiny change in population size n that occurs over each tiny change in time t) changes, as a function of the population size itself.

We can actually make this model even simpler, by replacing the birth and death rates with a single parameter $r$ which is just the difference between them:

$$
r = b-d
$$

This means that $r$ represents the population's per-capita rate of change. We can replace $b$ and $d$ with $r$ in our equation, making it:

$$
\frac{dn}{dt} = rn(t)
$$

Our goal is now going to be to infer $r$ from the data. But first, we have to simulate the data!

## Simulating the data in R

First, let's a couple of packages and setting the seed for the random number generator:

```r
library(rethinking)
library(deSolve)
set.seed(555)
```

We're going to start off by simulating the underlying exponential growth process. The first thing to do is to define a function which takes in values for the intial state `y0` and rate of change `r`, and spits out the derivative `dn.dt` for each time step:

```r
exp_growth <- function(times,y,parms){
  dn.dt <- r[1]*y[1]
  return(list(dn.dt))
}
```

The next step is to pick some values for the parameters, as well as a time sequence to simulate for. We're going to assume that our rate of change `r` is constant at all points in time:

```r
r <- 0.5 # Rate of change
y0 <- 1 # Initial state
time <- seq(0,10,by=0.1) # Time sequence
```

After this, we can simulate our true population size over time by using the `ode` function in the `deSolve` package to obtain the population size at each point in time:

```r
n_true <- ode(y=y0, times=time, func = exp_growth, parms = r)
```

We can plot it like so:

```r
plot(time, n_true[,2], ylab="Population size")
```

![](/assets/images/post_images/exponential_logistic_growth/exponential_true.jpeg)

This allows us to see the classic exponential growth curve.

Now that we've simulated our true population growth, we're going to simulate the observation process. I'm going to simulate the observed population size, `n_obs`, at each time-step using a $Poisson$ distribution where $\lambda$ is the true population size at a given time. This has a couple of good features: it ensures that the observed population size is always a positive integer (or zero), and it also means that the variation in observed values is greater when the population size is greater - which represents a scenario where measurement error is greater when the population is large. We can simulate and plot the observed data like this:

```r
n_obs <- rpois(n = length(time),
               lambda = n_true[,2])
plot(n_obs ~ time, xlab="Time", ylab="Observed population size")
points(time, n_true[,2], type="l", lwd=2)

```

![](/assets/images/post_images/exponential_logistic_growth/observed_exponential.jpeg)

Here I've plotted the true population trend in black, so you can see the way that the observed datapoints deviate from the line.

Now that we've simulated our data, we can prepare a data list for Stan. This requires some slight creativity due to the way that Stan indexes time steps (starting at 1, not at zero) - meaning we have to separate initial state bits `y0_obs` and `t0`, and subtract the first element from `y` and `ts`. We also have to subtract 1 from our time index `n_times`. The code looks like this:

```r
dlist <- list(
  n_times = length(time)-1L, # Number of timesteps
  y0_obs = n_obs[1], # Observed initial state
  y = n_obs[-1], # Observed data
  t0 = 0, # Initial timestep
  ts = time[-1] # Timesteps
)
```

We can now go on to code our model!

## Coding the model in Stan

Here is the full model:

```r
functions{
  vector exp_growth(real t, // Time
                    vector y, // State
                    real r){ // r parameter
    vector[1] dndt;
    dndt[1] = r*y[1]; 
    return dndt;
  }
}
data {
  int<lower=1> n_times; // Number of time steps minus one
  array[n_times] int y; // Observed data, minus initial state
  int<lower=0> y0_obs; // Observed initial state
  real t0; // First time step
  array[n_times] real ts; // Time steps
}
parameters {
  vector[1] y0; // Initial state
  real r; // Per-capita rate of population change
}
transformed parameters{
    // ODE solver
  vector[1] lambda[n_times] = ode_rk45(exp_growth, y0, t0, ts, r);
}
model {
  // Priors
  r ~ normal(0, 1);
  y0 ~ exponential(1);
  
  // Likelihood
  y0_obs ~ poisson(y0[1]);
  for (t in 1:n_times) {
    y[t] ~ poisson(lambda[t]);
  }
}
generated quantities{
  array[n_times+1] int n_sim;
  n_sim[1] = poisson_rng(y0[1]);
  for(t in 1:n_times){
    n_sim[t+1] = poisson_rng(lambda[t,1]);
  }
}
```

Now let's go through it step-by-step!

### The functions block

```r
functions{
  vector exp_growth(real t, // Time 
                    vector y, // State
                    real r){ // r parameter
    vector[1] dndt;
    dndt[1] = r*y[1];
    return dndt;
  }
}
```

The functions block is where a lot of the action happens for ODE-based models like ours, so it's worth spending a little bit of time on.

Apparently the way that ODE's work in Stan was [changed relatively recently](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/convert_odes.html), however it seems to me that the general idea hasn't changed - we write a function for our ODE in the functions block, and then give this function to the **ODE solver** later on in our model.

There are essentially two parts to our function. The first bit, from left to right, tells the function that we want our output as a `vector` (this is the only option allowed), that our function is called `exp_growth` (you can name it anything you like), and that our function has three inputs: `real t`, which is a time; `vector y`, which is the system's state; and `real r` which is our ODE's single parameter $r$. We could add more inputs if we had more parameters - this is exactly what we'll do in the logistic growth model later on.

The second part of our function is where we actually code the ODE. We first have to make a vector, which I've called `dndt`, to store our time derivatives (i.e., our output). We then get to do the interesting bit, which is to actually code our differential equation: `dndt[1] = r*y[1];`. Finally, we just ask the function to return our output, `dndt`.

### The data block

```r
data {
  int<lower=1> n_times; // Number of time steps minus one
  array[n_times] int y; // Observed data, minus initial state
  int<lower=0> y0_obs; // Observed initial state
  real t0; // First time step
  array[n_times] real ts; // Time steps
}
```

In this block we tell Stan about our data. Remember that when we were making `dlist` ealier on, we had to separate the initial state from the rest of the time series - we have to do the same thing in this block.

We first have `n_times`, which tells Stan how many time steps are after the initial state.

We then have our observed data `y`, as well as our observed initial state `y0_obs`.

After this, we have our initial time step `t0` followed by an array our time steps `ts`.

### The parameters block

```r
parameters {
  vector[1] y0; // Initial state
  real r; // Per-capita rate of population change
}
```

Here we tell Stan about the parameters of our model - the populaton's initial state `y0` and the per-capita rate of change `r`.

### The transformed parameters block

```r
transformed parameters{
    // ODE solver
  vector[1] lambda[n_times] = ode_rk45(exp_growth, y0, t0, ts, r);
}
```

This block contains the ODE solver - the function that solves the ODE, giving us an equation for the population size $n$ at any point in time.

In this example we're using the `ode_rk45` solver, which is often a good sover to start with. You can find out about the other solvers which Stan provides [in the Stan functions reference](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_29/functions-reference/functions-ode-solver.html). We need to give the solver our function `exp_growth` that we wrote in the functions block, the initial state parameter `y0`, the first timestep `t0` and the rest of the times `ts`, and our model's parameters - in this case, it's just `r`.

This code needs to go in the transformed parameters block, rather than the model block, so that `lambda` is available to the generated quantities block later on.

### The model block

```r
model {
  // Priors
  r ~ normal(0, 1);
  y0 ~ exponential(1);
  
  // Observation model
  y0_obs ~ poisson(y0[1]);
  for (t in 1:n_times) {
    y[t] ~ poisson(lambda[t]);
  }
}
```

In this block, we start of by specifying priors for the parameters in our model. I've assumed a $Normal(0, 1)$ prior for $r$, which is probably not a great choice since we are probably going to know that the population is increasing over time (meaning $r$ must be positive) - but it'll do for this example. I've given the initial state `y0` an $exponential(1)$ prior, since we know for certain it has to be positive (it can't be negative because a negative population size makes no sense, and if it's zero then we'll only ever observe zero individuals so we'll hopefully notice pretty quickly!) and it's also likely to be small.

After the priors, we have the section of the model which deals with the observation process. The first line models the initial state, and the `for` loop deals with all of the subsequent timesteps.

### The generated quantities block

```r
generated quantities{
  array[n_times+1] int n_sim;
  n_sim[1] = poisson_rng(y0[1]);
  for(t in 1:n_times){
    n_sim[t+1] = poisson_rng(lambda[t,1]);
  }
}
```

In this block, we're going to perform posterior predictive simulations - at each sampling iteration, we're going to simulate a population time series `n_sim` using the `lambda` values from that iteration and the `poisson_rng` random number generator for the Poisson distribution. Later on, we're going to compare these simulated values against the observed data to evaluate the model's fit.

Actually coding this block is a little bit of a pain, mostly due to indexing - because we separated the initial time step in the other parts of the model, we have to compute the first value of `n_sim` using our initial state parameter `y0[1]`, and then compute all of the other `n_sim` values using the appropriate `lambda` value. In order to make the indexes match up in the correct place, we have to define `n_sim` as having `n_times+1` values and then index it as `n_sim[t+1]` in the `for` loop.

## Running the model and exploring the output

We first need to save our model as a `.stan` file somewhere - when that's done, we can run the model using the `cstan` function in the `rethinking` package:

```r
m_exp <- cstan(file = "C:/Stan_code/exponential_growth.stan",
               data = dlist,
               chains = 4,
               cores = 4,
               warmup = 1500,
               iter = 2500,
               seed = 654)
```

The model will now compile and sample - why not [help to classify some of my camera trap photos](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/peter-dot-stewart/prickly-pear-project-kenya) while it does so? :wink: When it's done, we can inspect the `precis` summary table - I'm going to just show the first few rows here, but the real thing is quite long:

```r
precis(m_exp, depth =3)
```

![](/assets/images/post_images/exponential_logistic_growth/exponential_precis.jpg)

As you can see, we have our initial state parameter `y0` and our rate of change `r` at the top. We then have the `lambda` values for the 100 timesteps after the initial step, followed (in the non-truncated version you'll see if you run the code) by the 101 `n_sim` values produced by the `generated quantities` block. At this point we're particularly interested in our effective sample size `n_eff` and Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic `Rhat4` - we want the first to be a reasonably high number (ours look fine here), and we want the latter to equal one. It's also a good idea to inspect traceplots for our key parameters at this point:

```r
traceplot(m_exp, pars=c("y0[1]","r"))
```

Now we see that the model has sampled successfully, we can figure out whether it did a good job fitting the data. The first thing that we can do (since we simulated the data and know the true parameter values!) is to see how well the model estimated the per-capita rate of change, $r$ - as this is the parameter that we're really interested in:

```r
dens(post$r)
abline(v=r, lty=2)
```

![](/assets/images/post_images/exponential_logistic_growth/dens_r.jpeg)

The model has really hit the nail on the head here - the true value for $r$ is right in the middle of our posterior distribution!

We can also plot the model's posterior predictions against the raw data, like this:

```r
x_seq <- seq(0,10,0.1)

n_sim_mu <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, median)
n_sim_99CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.99)
n_sim_95CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.95)
n_sim_89CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.89)
n_sim_80CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.80)
n_sim_70CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.70)
n_sim_60CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.60)

plot(NULL, xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,200), xlab="Time", ylab="Population")
lines(x_seq, n_sim_mu, lwd=2)
shade(n_sim_99CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_95CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_89CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_80CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_70CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_60CI, x_seq)

points(x_seq, n_obs)
```

![](/assets/images/post_images/exponential_logistic_growth/exponential_posterior_prediction.jpeg)

The fit looks very good!

# Logistic growth

## Introducing the model

Populations can't just grow exponentially forever - sooner or later, intraspecific competition, limited resources and other factors prevent the population from growing further.

To model this idea, we can extend the exponential growth model by introducing a **carrying capacity** ($K$), which is the maximum size which our population will reach. We can include $K$ in our model n such a way that when the population size equals the carrying capacity, $\frac{dn}{dt}$ will equal zero and the population will cease to grow any further. This means that the rate of population growth is **density dependent** - as the population gets larger, the rate of increase slows. The model looks like this:

$$
\frac{dn}{dt} = rn(t)\left(1-\frac{n(t)}{K}\right)
$$

You can actually derive this specific equation by assuming that $r$ declines linearly as the population size increases - Otto and Day cover this in their book, so I'm not going to go into it here.

## Simulating the data in R

Simulating data for logistic growth is actually very similar to the process we carried out for exponential growth, so rather than going through it step-by-step I'm just going to present the whole simulation code in one go. The main change is that we've changed our function to the equation for logistic growth, and we've added the parameter for the carrying capacity `K` in the appropriate places:

```r
# Function for logistic growth
logistic_growth <- function(times,y,parms){
  dn.dt <- r[1]*y[1]*(1-(y[1]/K))
  return(list(dn.dt))
}

# Values for parameters and time sequence 
r <- 0.5 # Per-capita rate of change
K <- 50 # Carrying capacity
y0 <- 1 # Initial state
time <- seq(0,25,by=0.1) # Time sequence

# Simulate true population size 
n_true <- ode(y=y0, times=time, func = logistic_growth, parms = c(r,K))

plot(time, n_true[,2])

# Simulate observation process
n_obs <- rpois(n = length(time),
               lambda = n_true[,2])

# Plot observed data and true line
plot(n_obs ~ time, xlab="Time", ylab="Number of individuals")
points(time, n_true[,2], type="l", lwd=2)

# Make a data list for Stan
dlist <- list(
  n_times = length(time)-1L,
  y0_obs = n_obs[1],
  y = n_obs[-1],
  t0 = 0,
  ts = time[-1]
)

```

Plotting the observed data along with `n_true`, we can see how our datapoints fall around the classic "S-curve":

![](/assets/images/post_images/exponential_logistic_growth/logistic_observed.jpeg)

## Coding the model in Stan

Now we can code the model in Stan. Here is the full model:

```r
functions{
  vector logistic_growth(real t,
                    vector y,
                    real r,
                    real K){
    vector[1] dndt;
    dndt[1] = r*y[1]*(1-(y[1]/K));
    return dndt;
  }
}
data {
  int<lower=1> n_times;
  array[n_times] int y;
  int<lower=0> y0_obs;
  real t0;
  array[n_times] real ts;
}
parameters {
  vector[1] y0;
  real r;
  real K;
}
transformed parameters{
    // ODE solver
  vector[1] lambda[n_times] = ode_rk45(logistic_growth, y0, t0, ts, r, K);
}
model {
  // Priors
  r ~ normal(0, 1);
  y0 ~ exponential(1);
  K ~ exponential(0.05);
  
  // Likelihood
  y0_obs ~ poisson(y0[1]);
  for (t in 1:n_times) {
    y[t] ~ poisson(lambda[t]);
  }
}
generated quantities{
  array[n_times+1] int n_sim;
  n_sim[1] = poisson_rng(y0[1]);
  for(t in 1:n_times){
    n_sim[t+1] = poisson_rng(lambda[t,1]);
  }
}
```

It actually looks really similar to the exponential growth model - there are **only a few minor changes to the functions, parameters, transformed parameters, and model blocks.** Let's go through these step by step:

### The functions block

This is the bit with the most changes, but even here they're pretty minor - we've just added a slot for our carrying capacity `K` in our function, and changed the equation to the one for the logistic growth model.

### The data block

No changes here!

### The parameters block

In this block, we've just added the parameter `K` for the carrying capacity.

### The transformed parameters block

The only thing new here is adding `K` to the `ode_rk45` function.

### The model block

The only thing we've changed here is adding a prior for the carrying capacity, `K`. There are probably better choices than the $exponential(0.05)$ prior I've got here, but my choice does at least constrain `K` to be positive.

### The generated quantities block

No changes here!

## Running the model and exploring the output

We can run the model and explore the output using almost the same code as we used for the exponential growth model - we just have to substitute in the new model name where appropriate, and slightly alter the scale at which we're plotting the data due to the different time and population ranges we're dealing with. Here is all of the code to run the model, check the summary table and traceplots, and plot our posterior predictions against the observed data:

```r
# Run the model
m_log <- cstan(file = "C:/Stan_code/logistic_growth.stan",
               data = dlist,
               chains = 4,
               cores = 4,
               warmup = 1500,
               iter = 2500,
               seed = 543)

# Summary table
precis(m_log, depth =3)

# Traceplots for key parameters
traceplot(m_log, pars=c("y0[1]","r","K"))

# Extract posterior samples
post <- extract.samples(m_log)

# Density plots for key parameters - vertical lines for true values
par(mfrow=c(1,2)
dens(post$r)
abline(v=r,lty=2)
dens(post$K)
abline(v=K, lty=2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1)

# Posterior predictive plot
x_seq <- seq(0,25,0.1)

# Calculate mean and compatability intervals for n_sim
n_sim_mu <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, median)
n_sim_99CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.99)
n_sim_95CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.95)
n_sim_89CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.89)
n_sim_80CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.80)
n_sim_70CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.70)
n_sim_60CI <- apply(post$n_sim, 2, HPDI, prob=0.60)

# Make the plot
plot(NULL, xlim=c(0,25), ylim=c(0,80), xlab="Time", ylab="Population")
lines(x_seq, n_sim_mu, lwd=2)
shade(n_sim_99CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_95CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_89CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_80CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_70CI, x_seq)
shade(n_sim_60CI, x_seq)

points(x_seq, n_obs) # Add points for raw data

```

Looking at our values for $r$ (left) and $K$ (right), we can see that the model has accurately estimated both parameters:

And when we plot the model's posterior predictions against the raw data, we see a great fit:
